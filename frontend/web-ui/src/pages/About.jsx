      <h1>About the Blockchain Voting System</h1>
      <p>
        The Blockchain Voting System prototype ensures security, transparency, and
        verifiability of elections. Using Hyperledger Fabric, Smart Contracts, and
        Chameleon Hashing, each vote is immutable and auditable.
      </p>
      <p>
        DigiLocker authentication ensures that only verified citizens can participate.
        This increases trust and prevents fraudulent voting.
